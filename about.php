                    For those who want to know more about how I take the pictures, I use a Nikon F100 for almost all of the 35mm pictures. If thats too big, I have an olympus mju-1. For the 6cm&sup2; photos,
                    I have a Yashica-Mat 124G(When it wants to work). I don't use any filters besides UV and polarizing. That means theres no editing done to the photos unless stated other than matching the color
                    to how it looks on a light table.
